# LimeLight 

## Overview
**LimeLight** is an intelligent, autonomous assistant integrated into a community platform. It focuses on detecting, retrieving, and responding to user-generated content related to **Oracle**, its products, and subsidiaries using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline powered by **LangChain**, **ChromaDB**, and **LLaMA 3**.

This project aims to make community engagement more meaningful and efficient by automating informative replies and offering sentiment-aware context.

## Features

### 1. Oracle RAG Assistant (LimeLight Bot)
- Detects **Oracle-related content** using keyword filtering and semantic similarity.
- Retrieves relevant information from a **ChromaDB vector store**.
- Uses **LLaMA 3 (via Ollama)** to generate context-aware replies using LangChain's RAG pipeline.
- Performs  **sentiment analysis** to enrich response tone.
- Ensures high-quality responses only for verified Oracle-related topics.

### 2. Post Interaction and Auto-Commenting
- When a **user creates a post**, the system:
  - Checks if it's Oracle-related.
  - If yes, triggers the `generate_response()` function from `bot.py`.
  - Inserts a **comment** from LimeLight into the database and displays it on the post thread.
- Comments are tagged as authored by "LimeLight" and timestamped.

### 3. FastAPI Community Platform
- Built using **FastAPI**, **MongoDB**, and **Jinja2**.
- Routes for user posts and viewing threads.
- Lightweight frontend for displaying posts and bot replies.
- Modular design (`main.py`, `response.py`, `bot.py`) to separate concerns.

## Machine Learning / NLP Used

### 1. RAG Pipeline
- Uses **ChromaDB** to store and retrieve Oracle data chunks.
- Embeds data using **HuggingFace sentence transformers**.
- Queries are processed via **LangChain** for:
  - Similarity search.
  - Augmented response generation using **LLaMA 3**.

### 2. Oracle Relevance Detection
- Checks for keywords like *oracle*, *oci*, *fusion apps*, *netsuite*, etc.
- Planned enhancement: Use an LLM classifier for better accuracy.

### 3. Sentiment Analysis *(Planned)*
- Analyze user tone (positive, negative, neutral).
- Adapt LimeLightâ€™s responses to be empathetic or supportive when needed.
